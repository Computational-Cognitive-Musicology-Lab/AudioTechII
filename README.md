### Activities
Activities relate to class lectures and offer opportunities for students to test out functions or practice skills in a clean Jupyter notebook with directives (without having to modify the lecture material notebooks).

### Audio and Image folders
Note that notebooks point to audio and image files from the separate directories. Renaming the directories will cause the notebooks to error. As such, it is advised not to change directory names.

### Interactive Tools
Interactive web tools (originally created by Jiaying Li) are provided for additional reference and hands-on manipulation using a GUI without having to code any parameters. The interaction tools are [available here:](https://jiayingli0803.github.io/AudioTechII_GRA/interaction/interaction.html)
